# LooLookr

LooLookr is a full-stack TypeScript app for discovering and rating campus bathrooms. Students can browse nearby restrooms, submit ratings, and share quick notes so others know what to expect. The frontend is built with React + Vite, and the backend uses Express + MongoDB with JWT auth stored in HTTP-only cookies.

## Run with Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173`.
